      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Peniel Leonard Ankomah, but you can call me Peniel. I wear many hats: 
        a mechanical engineering student, a data science enthusiast, a kindergarten teacher, 
        and the Secretary of Kingdom Witness Chapel International, New Amanful Assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a deep passion for integrating technology into education and architecture. 
        I’m currently exploring AR/VR/MR applications for architects, aiming to revolutionize 
        how they interact with 3D models on-site. My journey also includes crafting interactive 
        experiences with React and delving into machine learning for real-world problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside work and studies, I enjoy researching innovative ideas, organizing events for 
        Favoured Foundation Vocational Institute, and inspiring the next generation of learners. Life is a blend of curiosity, creativity, and purpose for me.
